# Computer Graphics Assignments

This is a collection of all the assignments of the course Computer Graphics held by Politecnico di Milano during my Telecommunication Engineering master degree in 2022.

## Folders

Each folder correspond to one assignment.  
We were provided a _.pdf_ with the requirements and and then the two _.cpp_ files of the solution.
Folder _headers, models, shaders_ and _textures_ contains all the files that are necessary to correctly display the solutions of the assignments and was already provided.

## Usage

There are two Makefiles, one that compiles the shaders and doesn't do it. Just copy the needed one into the _Makefile_ file.
Then just change _DIR_ and _NAME_ with the directory name and the main file name of the assignment (ex. DIR=A01, NAME=Assignment01). Then open a terminal and type:

```bash
make
```
